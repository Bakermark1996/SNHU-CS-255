Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was DriverPass. They wanted a system where customers could log in, set up appointments and be able to study online for upcomming driving test that they may need to take in the future.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I did a good job planning out what needed to be done for the project. Understanding what the project was about and how to find the answers I needed when it came to the Business requirements document.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I did a great job on most of the document. I think the performance requirements could use more work, we needed to know more about how they wanted their system to run and that wasn't going to be able to be given to us for the project. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Learning what the user and clients needs is the most important thing when designing a system. You are catering to the people who want to use the system you are creating and it doesn't matter what you want it matters what they want as an end product. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I took a long look at what the document needed to be answered effectively. Learning what the requirements for creating such an expansive system can be hard but as long as you think about what you need to get there you learn a lot along the way. I think my biggest strength was to be able to understand what the client needed when talking about what they wanted for the project/system.
